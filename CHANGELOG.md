## Version Strategy

We follow semantic versioning:
- **Major (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)**: Breaking changes requiring project updates
- **Minor (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Version Tags for Consumers

Projects can reference versions in multiple ways:

```yaml
# Recommended: Pin to major version (gets minor/patch updates)
uses: your-org/maintenance-actions/add-update-label-weekly@v1

# Pin to minor version (gets patch updates only)
uses: your-org/maintenance-actions/add-update-label-weekly@v1.0

# Pin to exact version (no automatic updates)
uses: your-org/maintenance-actions/add-update-label-weekly@v1.0.0

# Not recommended: Use latest commit
uses: your-org/maintenance-actions/add-update-label-weekly@main
```

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from Pre-1.0 (Legacy Implementation)

If you're migrating from a project-local implementation:

1. **Create label directory** (`.github/maintenance-actions/label-directory.yml`)
   ```yaml
   statusUpdated: "Status: Updated"
   statusInactive1: "Status: To Update"
   statusInactive2: "Status: Inactive"
   # Add your other labels...
   ```

2. **Create config file** (`.github/maintenance-actions/add-update-label-config.yml`)
   - Copy your hardcoded values from the old implementation
   - Use example config as a template

3. **Update workflow file** (`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`)
   ```yaml
   # Old
   - uses: actions/github-script@v7
     with:
       script: |
         # Inline script here...
   
   # New
   - uses: your-org/maintenance-actions/add-update-label-weekly@v1
     with:
       github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

4. **Test with dry-run** before going live

5. **Remove old files** once confirmed working
   - Old inline scripts
   - Old local action files
