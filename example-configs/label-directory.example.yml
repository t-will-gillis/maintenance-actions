# Label Directory
# ==============================================================================
#
# If this file does not already exist in your repo, copy this example file
# to `.github/maintenance-actions/label-directory.yml`. If you have copied this 
# file previously, continue editing your existing `label-directory.yml` file.
# 
# This file maps 'label keys' (left side, used internally by the workflow) to the 
# actual 'label names' used in your GitHub repository (right side):
#
#   labelKey: "Actual Label Name in GitHub"
#
# Do not edit the label keys. Do, however, edit the label names to match the 
# labels you are using in your project, especially any required labels noted  
# in the `add-update-label-config.yml` file.
#
# When you implement additional workflows in the future, continue editing this 
# same file for any additional labels noted in those workflows.
#
# ==============================================================================
# How to customize this file
# ==============================================================================
# 1. Make sure all label names on the right side match EXACTLY the labels 
#    that exist in your GitHub repository (including capitalization and spacing)
#
# 2. DO NOT CHANGE the label keys on the left side - these are used internally
#    by the workflow code
#
# 3. You can change the label names on the right to match your project's 
#    naming conventions. For example:
#      statusUpdated: "My Custom Updated Label"
#
# 4. If you add new label key: name value pairs to your config file, add them here too
#
# 5. Make sure label names exist in your GitHub repository before running the workflow
#
# 6. The label names shown here are defaults and should be changed to match your project
#
# 7. In case you missed it-  DO NOT CHANGE the label keys on the left side
